# ament_cmake needs a Python 3 interpreter
# If a specific Python version is required then find it before finding ament_cmake
# Example:
#   find_package(Python3 3.8 REQUIRED)
#   find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
#
# FindPython3 is only available in CMake 3.12 or higher,
# so we need at least that version.
