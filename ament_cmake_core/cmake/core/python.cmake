# ament_cmake needs a Python 3 interpreter
# If a specific Python version is required then find it before finding ament_cmake
# Example:
#   find_package(Python3 3.8 REQUIRED)
#   find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
if(NOT TARGET Python3::Interpreter)
  # We expect that Python dependencies are met for whatever Python interpreter
  # is invoked by the "python3" executable, however this may not be the latest
  # Python version installed on the system. The default behavior of
  # find_package(Python3) is to use the latest version (i.e. python3.12), so we
  # specifically look for a "python3" executable and if found, instruct
  # find_package(Python3) to use that.
  # On Windows, the find_package(Python3) logic is different and doesn't
  # appear to prefer specific versions (i.e. python3.12) over plain
  # "python.exe" so this extra logic is unnecessary there.
