Changelog for package ament_cmake_core
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.0.7 (2024-11-09)
------------------

2.0.6 (2024-07-11)
------------------
* More specific prefix in some cmake_parse_argument calls (`#537 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/537>`_)
* Contributors: Kevin Egger

2.0.5 (2024-04-19)
------------------
* Require CMake 3.12 due to introduction of FindPython3 (`#515 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/515>`_)
* Contributors: Ryan

2.0.4 (2024-02-07)
------------------
* Fix CMake error when entire ament projects are added via add_subdirectory (`#487 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/487>`_)
* Contributors: Silvio Traversaro

2.0.3 (2023-06-22)
------------------

2.0.2 (2023-04-12)
------------------

2.0.1 (2023-04-11)
------------------

2.0.0 (2023-04-11)
------------------
* ament_cmake_uninstall_target: Correct location of install_manifest.txt (`#432 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/432>`_)
* Contributors: Silvio Traversaro

1.5.3 (2023-02-13)
------------------
* Use file(GENERATE OUTPUT) to create dsv files (`#416 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/416>`_)
  Using file(WRITE) and file(APPEND) causes the modification stamp of the
  file to be changed each time CMake configures, resluting in an
  'Installing' message rather than an 'Up-to-date' message even though the
  file content is identical.
  Using file(GENERATE OUTPUT) updates the timestamp of the file only if
  the content changes.
* Warn when trying to symlink install an INTERFACE_LIBRARY (`#417 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/417>`_)
* Workaround to exclude Clion's cmake folders from colcon test (`#410 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/410>`_)
  - Add AMENT_IGNORE to CMAKE_BINARY_DIR to avoid picking up cmake
  specific folders created by CLion in `colcon build` and `colcon test`
  commands
* if (NOT ${UNDEFINED_VAR}) gets evaluated to false, so change to if (NOT UNDEFINED_VAR) so it evaluates to true. (`#407 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/407>`_)
* [rolling] Update maintainers - 2022-11-07 (`#411 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/411>`_)
  * Update maintainers to Michael Jeronimo
* Contributors: Audrow Nash, Kenji Brameld, Michael Orlov, Scott K Logan, Shane Loretz

------------------

1.3.0 (2022-02-17)
------------------
* Update forthcoming version in changelog
* Contributors: Audrow Nash

1.2.1 (2022-01-14)
------------------
* Resolve various ament_lint linter violations (`#360 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/360>`_)
  We can't add ament_lint linters in ament_cmake in the traditional way
  without creating a circular dependency between the repositories. Even
  though we can't automatically enforce linting, it's still a good idea to
  try to keep conformance where possible.
* Update maintainers to Michael Jeronimo and Michel Hidalgo (`#362 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/362>`_)
* Contributors: Audrow Nash, Scott K Logan

1.2.0 (2021-10-29)

* doc/resource_index: Indent list subitems correctly (`#342 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/342>`_)
* Update maintainers (`#336 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/336>`_)
* Contributors: Chris Lalancette, Michal Sojka, Shane Loretz

* Make it possible to ignore a package deprecation warning
  Wrap the deprecation warning message in a conditional, letting callers set a variable to quiet the warning.

0.5.0 (2018-06-13)
------------------
* change order of _CONFIG_EXTRAS_POST `#140 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/140>`_
* Fix ${PROJECT_NAME}_CONFIG_EXTRAS_POST (`#140 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/140>`_)

  * project specific variable after the global populated by functions
* fix typos. (`#138 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/138>`_)
* Always write generated cmake as utf8 (`#136 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/136>`_)
  * Always write output as utf-8.
  CMake documentation suggests that we should be writing 7-bit ascii
  CMake source files or writing UTF-8 with a byte order mark. (Source:
  https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/manual/cmake-language.7.html#encoding).
  This doesn't actually do either of those things. It just cements our
  position of non-compliance (writing utf-8 without a byte order mark)
  so that builds don't crash if the system encoding is other than utf-8.
  Alternatively we could sanitize the generated CMake content so it is
  7-bit ascii and explicitly write it as such or consider adding the byte
  order mark.
  * Always read package.xml as utf-8.

  escape sequences or as line continuations.
