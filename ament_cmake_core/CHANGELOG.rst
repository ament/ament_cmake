1.2.1 (2022-01-14)
------------------
* Resolve various ament_lint linter violations (`#360 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/360>`_)
  We can't add ament_lint linters in ament_cmake in the traditional way
  without creating a circular dependency between the repositories. Even
  though we can't automatically enforce linting, it's still a good idea to
  try to keep conformance where possible.
* Update maintainers to Michael Jeronimo and Michel Hidalgo (`#362 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/362>`_)

------------------------
* Make it possible to ignore a package deprecation warning
  Wrap the deprecation warning message in a conditional, letting callers set a variable to quiet the warning.
* Use DEPRECATION instead of WARNING for package deprecation messages
  This makes it possible to treat the warnings differently in downstream packages.
  Refer to the CMake documentation for more info: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/message.html

0.5.0 (2018-06-13)
------------------
* change order of _CONFIG_EXTRAS_POST `#140 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/140>`_
* Fix ${PROJECT_NAME}_CONFIG_EXTRAS_POST (`#140 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/140>`_)
  * Fix `#139 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/139>`_.
  * project specific variable after the global populated by functions
* fix typos. (`#138 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/138>`_)
* Always write generated cmake as utf8 (`#136 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/136>`_)
  * Always write output as utf-8.
  CMake documentation suggests that we should be writing 7-bit ascii
  CMake source files or writing UTF-8 with a byte order mark. (Source:
  https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.5/manual/cmake-language.7.html#encoding).
  This doesn't actually do either of those things. It just cements our
  position of non-compliance (writing utf-8 without a byte order mark)
  so that builds don't crash if the system encoding is other than utf-8.
  Alternatively we could sanitize the generated CMake content so it is
  7-bit ascii and explicitly write it as such or consider adding the byte
  order mark.
  * Always read package.xml as utf-8.

  escape sequences or as line continuations.
