------------------
* Update forthcoming version in changelog
* Contributors: Audrow Nash

1.2.1 (2022-01-14)
------------------
* Resolve various ament_lint linter violations (`#360 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/360>`_)
  We can't add ament_lint linters in ament_cmake in the traditional way
  without creating a circular dependency between the repositories. Even
  though we can't automatically enforce linting, it's still a good idea to
  try to keep conformance where possible.
* Update maintainers to Michael Jeronimo and Michel Hidalgo (`#362 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/362>`_)

1.0.2 (2020-12-07)
------------------
* Update package maintainers. (`#286 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/286>`_)
* Contributors: Michel Hidalgo

1.0.1 (2020-09-10)
------------------
* Fix skipped test reporting in CTest (`#279 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/279>`_)
  This is a follow-up to c67cdf2. When the SKIP_RETURN_CODE gets set to 0,
  the value is interpreted as 'false', and the test property is never
  actually added.
* limit test time to three decimals (`#271 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/271>`_)
* Add actual test time to xUnit result files (`#270 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/270>`_)
  * Add actual test time to xUnit result files
  Fixes `#269 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/269>`_
  * Report test_time even with skipped test
  * Set time attribute for testcase element
* Contributors: Dirk Thomas, Ruffin, Scott K Logan

1.0.0 (2020-07-22)
------------------
* Add SKIP_RETURN_CODE argument to ament_add_test (`#264 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/264>`_)
  This makes the `run_test.py` wrapper aware of the `SKIP_RETURN_CODE`
  property on CTest tests. In the existing implementation, the wrapper
  detects that no result file was generated and overrides the special
  return code coming from the test, making the the CTest feature fail
  completely.
  This change makes the wrapper script aware of the special return code,
  and when detected, will write a 'skipped' result file instead of a
  'failed' result file, and pass along the special return code as-is. Now
  the gtest result and the ctest results both show the test as 'skipped'
  when the special return flag is used.
  Note that none of this behavior is enabled by default, which is
  important because we wouldn't want a test to fail and return a code
  which we've decided is the special 'skip' return code. Only tests which
  are aware of this feature should use it.

0.9.6 (2020-06-23)
------------------

0.9.5 (2020-06-02)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#253 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/253>`_ from ament/use_errors_tag2
  Use errors attribute for problems when testing code (take II)
* Error message needs to be inside its own XML tag according to XSD
* Use DEPRECATION instead of WARNING for package deprecation messages
  This makes it possible to treat the warnings differently in downstream packages.
  Refer to the CMake documentation for more info: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/message.html

0.9.2 (2020-05-07)
------------------
* Fix parallel testing (`#254 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/254>`_)
  * Fix parallel testing
  We ran ctest . -j 10, and sometimes it happened that we got failing CI builds because the command in line 116 was executed in parallel.

0.9.1 (2020-04-24 15:45)
------------------------

0.9.0 (2020-04-24 12:25)
------------------------
* Report skipped tests in CTest output (`#243 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/243>`_)
  When adding a test using `ament_add_test`, the `SKIP_TEST` argument
  results in the `--skip-test` argument being passed to the test wrapper
  script `run_test.py`. The wrapper script then writes a JUnit output
  describing that the test was skipped, and returns 0.
  As far as CTest knows, the test succeeded and shows `Passed` on the
  console. However, since we know that the test will be skipped by the
  wrapper, and we expect the wrapper to return 0 after it writes the JUnit
  file, we can set a test property that will mark the test as `Skipped`
  when the wrapper returns 0.
  This way, the JUnit output file is still written, but CTest displays the
  test as skipped as well.
* Drop duplicated <skipped/> element in result file (`#242 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/242>`_)
  The `<skipped/>` element was actually added as part of the
  `skipped_message` several lines earlier.
  While multiple `<skipped/>` elements doesn't violate the JUnit schema,
  there is no reason to have more than one.
* add CMake function ament_add_test_label() (`#240 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/240>`_)
* Merge pull request `#225 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/225>`_ from ament/junit10_xsd
  Generate xunit files valid for the junit10.xsd
* Generate xunit files valid for the junit10.xsd
* Declare AMENT_TEST_RESULTS_DIR as a PATH (`#221 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/221>`_)
* remove status attribute from result XML, add skipped tag instead (`#218 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/218>`_)
* Run tests in current binary directory, not global source directory (`#206 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/206>`_)
  Switch to CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR for consistency with CTest
* Contributors: Dan Rose, Dirk Thomas, Jose Luis Rivero, Scott K Logan

0.8.1 (2019-10-23)
------------------

* use deterministic order for updated env vars (`#196 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/196>`_)
* improve handling of encoding (`#181 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/181>`_)
* Add runner option to ament_add_test (`#174 <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/issues/174>`_)
  * ament_cmake allow speficiation of a different test runner
  - By default, still uses run_test.py
  - Example use case: ament_cmake_ros can use a test runner that sets a ROS_DOMAIN_ID

  - This should let us see the history
